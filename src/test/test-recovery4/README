Test what happens if a service needs to get recovered but select_service_node
cannot return any possible node, and then the user triggers some CRM comand
like `migration`, `stop` and finally a `disable`

Expected Result:
Try recovery continuosly, ignore the migrate and stop command, we cannot honor
them for a in `recovery` service. For now also the `disabled` one is a no-op.
